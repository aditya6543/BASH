It is designed with safety as a primary concern, defaulting to a dry-run mode and offering tag-based exclusion to protect essential assets.The script is ideal for managing non-production environments (Dev, QA, Staging) where resource sprawl can lead to significant, unnecessary costs.Table of ContentsUrgent Security WarningCore FeaturesBusiness Use CasesSystem PrerequisitesInstallation and ConfigurationOperational GuideScope of OperationsContributingLicense⚠️ Urgent Security WarningRISK OF PERMANENT DATA LOSSThis script is a powerful and destructive tool designed to permanently delete resources from your AWS account. Operations are irreversible.Mandatory First Step: Always execute in the default dry-run mode to audit the list of resources targeted for deletion.Verify Target Account: Ensure your AWS CLI is configured for the correct account and region before execution.Implement Safeguards: Utilize the --keep-tag functionality to create a clear "safe list" of resources that must not be deleted.Disclaimer of Liability: The use of this script is entirely at your own risk. The authors and contributors are not liable for any data loss or financial damages incurred.Core FeaturesOperational Safety: Defaults to a secure dry-run mode. The --execute flag is required for all destructive operations.Global & Regional Scope: Automatically discovers and operates across all active AWS regions to ensure comprehensive cleanup.Resource Exclusion: Protect critical assets from deletion using a simple, tag-based exclusion mechanism (--keep-tag KEY=VALUE).Intelligent Operation: Intentionally preserves core infrastructure such as EC2 instances, VPCs, Subnets, and IAM roles to prevent service disruption.Asynchronous Handling: Employs AWS CLI wait commands to manage dependencies and ensure long-running deletions complete successfully.Business Use CasesCost Optimization: Drastically reduce monthly AWS bills by eliminating orphaned and unused resources in development and testing accounts.Security Hygiene: Reduce the potential attack surface by removing old, unpatched, or unmonitored resources.Environment Management: Easily reset testing or QA environments to a clean slate, ensuring repeatable and consistent deployments.System PrerequisitesBash Environment: Version 4.0 or newer.AWS CLI: Version 2.x is required.Configured AWS Credentials: The script uses the AWS credentials configured in your environment. For details, see the AWS CLI Configuration Guide.Installation and ConfigurationClone the Repository:git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-directory>
Set Execute Permissions:chmod +x aws-cleanup-except-ec2.sh
Configure AWS Profile (Optional):The script uses your default AWS CLI profile. To use a specific profile, set the AWS_PROFILE environment variable:export AWS_PROFILE="your-profile-name"
Operational GuideStep 1: Audit Resources (Dry Run)Execute the script in its default mode to generate a non-destructive report of resources that will be deleted../aws-cleanup-except-ec2.sh
Sample Output:=== AWS CLEANUP SCRIPT (excludes EC2) ===
DRY_RUN: true

>>> Processing region: us-east-1
[DRY-RUN] aws ec2 release-address --allocation-id eipalloc-0123456789abcdef --region us-east-1
[DRY-RUN] aws rds delete-db-instance --db-instance-identifier my-test-db --skip-final-snapshot --region us-east-1
...
Step 2: Execute DeletionAfter carefully reviewing the dry-run output, proceed with the deletion using the --execute flag../aws-cleanup-except-ec2.sh --execute
Step 3: Protect Critical Assets (Recommended)To exclude specific resources from deletion, apply a consistent tag (e.g., Status=Protected) to them in the AWS Console and use the --keep-tag flag.# This command will not touch any resource tagged with "Status=Protected"
./aws-cleanup-except-ec2.sh --execute --keep-tag "Status=Protected"
